%%%% DEFINITION of FK_space ==============================================================%%%%%%%%
% "robot-agnostic." It takes in a robot object, reads the robot class for whatever screw axes defined
% and claculates product of exponentials up to the "end" frame. It assumes the final frame is based on the # of joint 
% coordinates are passed, therefore if a joint is not intended to move, pass "0" for that joint
